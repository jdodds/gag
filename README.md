UserScript that groups github alerts based on their project.

This is really more of a proof-of-concept at this point -- it's ugly, and breaks the "more" functionality on the main page.

Note: On OSX (Chrome and Firefox), I had trouble getting this to install by clicking on it. Worked fine under linux (Chrome and Firefox). If you click to install this, and the name doesn't show up as "gag", clone the repo, and install it via Ctrl-O.
